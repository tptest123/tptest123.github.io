To host your new story on the internet, try any of the numerous hosting services.


The simplest to use is GitHub Pages, and here's how you do it there:

1. If you don't have a GitHub account already, make one. It's free
2. Create a repository with the following name: USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME is your username
   For example, mine is named tadeaspaule.github.io
3. Upload the contents of the folder you exported (the one with index.html, style.css, etc.) into this repository
   Make sure you upload the contents, not the folder itself. The index.html file should be immediately visible
4. And done!

If you want to use some other service, the process will be similiar.
The main part is pointing the service to the index.html file, and that will handle the rest.
